									<h2>Who I am</h2>
									<p>My name is Benjamin Robert Sammons, and I am a Packaging Systems and Design Major with a Technical and Professional Wiritng Minor at Virginia Tech, and this is my website for my Writing and Digital Media Class. </p>
									<p>I have always had an interest in technology and innovation, and the real world examples of how they impact our daily lives. Which is why I decided to major in Packaging Systems and Design. No one really thinks about how much time and effort goes into the packaging all ur products come in, and the industry that it created is a multi-billion dollar endeavor that is at the forefront of innovation. Which is why I decided that I could fulfill my desire for a career based in technology with a lot fo problem solving in the world of Packaging.</p>
									<p>Outside of School, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, cooking. I also play the guitar and am an avid collector and builder of Legos. And that's all there really is to know about me, I hope you enjoy the work on this website!

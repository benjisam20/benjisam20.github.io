									<h2>Who I am</h2>
									<p>My name is Benjamin Robert Sammons, and I am a Packaging Systems and Design Major with a Technical and Professional Wiritng Minor at Virginia Tech, and this is my website for my Writing and Digital Media Class. </p>
									<p>I have always had an interest in technology and innovation, and the real world examples of how they impact our daily lives. Which is why I decided to major in Packaging Systems and Design, no one really thinks about how much time and effort goes into the packaging all ur products come in, and the industry that it created is a multi-billion dollar endeavor that is at the forefront of innovation. Which is why I decided that I could fulfill my desire for a career based in technology with a lot fo problem slving in the world of Packaging.</p>
									<p>However, no degree is every one thing, and I felt that a minor in Tehcnical and Professional wirting could only serve to help broaden my skills and give me an even better understanding of working in such a large industry, which is how I ended up in this class. This website will showcase a lot of the work that I did during my time in Writing and Digital Media, a lot of which has to deal with technology and how it impacts our society.</p>
									<p>Outside of School, I enjoy playing video games and love to watch movies. I also play the guitar and am an avid collector and builder of Legos. And that's all there really is to know about me, I hope you enjoy the work on this website!
